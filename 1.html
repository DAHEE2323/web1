<p><strong>Natural <u>wine</u>,</strong> then, is made from grapes not sprayed with pesticides or herbicides.</p>
<p>Natural wine refers to a generalized movement among winemakers for production of "natural" wine without pesticides, chemicals and other additives. Historically, it has been connected to the German Lebensreform movement, where it gained popularity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
Some <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">sources</a> claim that it started with winemakers in the Beaujolais region of France in the 1960s. These winemakers, namely Marcel Lapierre, Jean Foillard, Charly Thevenet and Guy Breton, sought a return to the way their grandparents made wine, before the incursion of pesticides and chemicals that had become so prevalent in agriculture after the end of World War II. They became affectionately known as The Gang of Four.[1] They were heavily influenced by the teachings and thoughts of Jules Chauvet and Jacques Neauport,[2] two oenologists who studied ways to make wines with fewer additives. For quite some time the town of Villié-Morgon became a place for like minded winemakers to congregate and become influenced by the Gang of Four. Gradually this movement spread to other regions of France, and since has spread across the world, gradually gaining in popularity and attracting newer younger winemakers in more and more regions of the world.
